JS Backend Project with added API functionality

Tech stack: MongoDB, Express, Node.js 

The html and css was provided.
The functionality was implemented by me.

Simple catalog for rubik cubes with authentication and authorization. 

If you are logged in user you can add your own cubes and edit/delete them and you can see the cubes catalog and the cubes details as well. You can attach accessories to your cubes(the ones you are owner of).

If you are a guest you can see the catalog and the cubes details but you can't edit/delete them (only the cube owner can do this!).
